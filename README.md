Student Directory
=================

Our first project at Makers Academy is to create a list of students on our course, and handle that data. This program runs entirely in the terminal.

Day 1 - directory.rb
---------------------

First attempt at making this student directory with Nicola! We set up our environment and git for this project. The program askes for students' names and put them into a nice array and output them onto the screen.


Day 2 - directory.rb
---------------------
Continued working on the student directory with Michiel. We also add some validation to check user input in our code. We also have an excersize in which we have to fix code without sublime highlighting (typos.rb)


Day 3 - directory.rb
---------------------
Tripled up with Jeremy (@foxjerem) and Peter (@petermccarthy49) today. We added an interactive menu, prompting users to choose what they want to do and was successful in saving student data (age and cohort) to a csv file. We did some major refactoring and split a big method into quite a few smaller ones, makeing our code much cleaner.

Day 4 - directory.rb
---------------------
We didn't work on our student directory today to focus on our Friday Challenge on the command line.


Day 5 - tdd-student-directory.rb
---------------------
Threesome with Alex and Iona today to re-do the student directory project TDD'ing it! We started with the menu and made a nice map of how the whole program will run. We also employed some IO objects and a whole bucketload of rspec basics we learned today.


Day 6 - tdd-student-directory-2.rb
---------------------
Paired with the lovely Zoe (@zoeabryant) today and we started to TDD our student directory from scratch. She taught me many fun sublime shortcuts I didn't know about before. We worked out how to test inputing and printing multiple students, and have students saved in a .csv file. 

Day 7 - tdd-student-directory-3.rb
---------------------
Paired with Hannah (@HanWax) today to redo the student directory with TDD. We learned more about loading and saving csv files and how to test for them.

Day 8 - tdd-student-directory-3.rb
---------------------
Continued to work on the student directory I started with Hannah yesteryday pairing with Dave (@Bayonnaise) today. We continued to TDD the program to have an interactive menu and allows user to input students, save students, load students back into the program after the program is exited, and exit the program. Dave introduced some slightly more advanced programming logic to me which were quite cool to implement.
